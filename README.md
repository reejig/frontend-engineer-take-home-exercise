## Introduction

Thanks for your interest in working at Reejig! As part of our interview process, we’d like you to complete this short assessment. This test will allow us to gain some insight as to how you go about solving problems while building user interfaces.

Please aim to spend no more than 90 minutes to 2 hours on this test. If you haven’t quite wrapped up everything by the 2 hour mark, it’s quite ok to submit what you’ve done.

If we schedule a follow up technical interview, we will use your test as a basis for some further discussions. We may also ask you to make some small changes.

## Project Information

- This project is set up using Vue 3 with Typescript as this is the frontend stack we use. If you have more experience using another framework then please remove Vue and set up the framework of your choice.
- In the root of the project is a consts.ts file. This file contains the URL for the endpoint you will need to request data from.
- Feel free to use any additional libraries you might need.
- Feel free to use a component library or CSS framework.
- We don’t expect pixel perfection, but please pay attention to details such as consistent alignment and spacing.

## Requirements

- Display user profiles in a list view.
- Using a text input, it should be possible to filter the list of profiles by full name.
- It should be possible to sort the list by the skills match (both ascending and descending).

- It should be possible to remove an individual profile.
